                    <h2>Health Here!: An Interactive Dashboard for Poplation Health in US</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The analysis plots relationships between income, obesity, poverty with demographic factors and health risks for 50 states and the District of Columbia in the US.
                        Median age, household income, and poverty rates are plotted against the smoking, lack of healthcare, and obesity rates for each state or district.

                            <li>The age demographic is densely populated within the middle age range from age 30-45.</li>
                            <li>States or districts with lower income or higher poverty rates show higher rates of health risks.</li>
                            <li>The findings from the data show that there is a positive correlation between the poverty rate (%), and the rate of risk factors % (Obese, Smokers, and Lack of Health Care). </li>
                            <li>There is a negative correlation between household income (Median), and the rate of risk factors % (Obese, smokes, and lack of health care).</li>

                        <h1>Poverty Rate or Household Income (Median) Versus Health Risks</h1>
                    </div>

                    <p>There seems to be a positive correlation between poverty rate (%) and the rate of risk factors. Lack of health care is also directly related to the poverty rate. On ther other hand, there is a negative correlation between household income (Median), and the rate of risk factors. When income increases the risk factors decrease.

                    <p>The relationship between age and health risks from the data needs more color. However, the age demographic is most in the age range of 30-45.  </p>
